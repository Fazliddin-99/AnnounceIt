# AnnounceIt

During the time I was studying in the universty each year we had to find and join the telegram channel of each subject and the professors would make different kind of announcements and share files that we need during our studies. I found it not so convenient and thought of an app that keeps the announcements and courses in one place. This is the app!

## Used technologies and libraries:
* **MVVM** architecture
* **Dagger Hilt** for dependency injection
* **Firebase Firestore** for saving and retrieving data online
* **Firebase Storage** - online storage for uploading into and loading files from
* **Retrofit** for http queries
* **Room** for caching data
* **Coroutines** for asynchronous execution of the code
* **Compose** for UI
* **Navigation Compose** for navigation through screens
* **Coil** for loading images
* **LiveData** and **Flow** for dynamic retrieval of the data and updating of the screen
